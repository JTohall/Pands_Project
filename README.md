## Project Objective ##

> This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. You must research the data set and write documentation and code (in Python) to investigate it. An
> online search for information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated it previously. You are expected to be able to break this project 
> into several smaller tasks that are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed.

## Fisher's Iris Data Set ##

Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis'. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. 
Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.
