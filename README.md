## Project Objective ##

> This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. You must research the data set and write documentation and code (in Python) to investigate it. An
> online search for information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated it previously. You are expected to be able to break this project 
> into several smaller tasks that are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed.
