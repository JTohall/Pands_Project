# Programming and Scripting Final Project - 2022

# This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set. You must research the data set and write documentation and code to investigate it.
# The programme must output a summary of each variable to a single text file, Save a histogram of each variable to png files and output a scatterplot of each pair of variables. 
# Perform any other analysis you think is appropriate.
